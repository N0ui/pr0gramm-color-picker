# pr0gramm-color-picker
Theming for pr0gramm


## Installation

I recommend to use Tampermonkey, because Greasemonkey throws strange errors and sometimes this script won't work.

### Download
- [Tampermonkey (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=de)
- [Tampermonkey (FireFox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
 - [Tampermonkey (Safari)](https://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari)

### Script

After downloading and installing your extension of choice, click on this Link and you're ready to go.

## How to

A new menu point is added to the pr0gramm footer (left bottom)
Click on it and choose your colors.
